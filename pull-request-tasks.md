# Refining Pull Requests

Copilot Workspace supports tasks to refine pull requests.

Here you give a task description explicitly, and the task takes into account the specific code changes in the PR.

Once started a pull request task looks like this:

After creation, pull request tasks proceed as for issue tasks. On completion, you are offered an additional option to update the pull request.

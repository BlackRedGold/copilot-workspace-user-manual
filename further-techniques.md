## Creating Repositories from Templates

The task is based on the description of the software to create, plus the README of the template repo. You can also start this kind of task by creating a [New Session in Copilot Workspace](https://copilot-workspace.githubnext.com/new). Once started a create repository task looks like this:

## Refining Pull Requests

Here you give a task description explicitly, and the task takes into account the specific code changes in the PR. Once started a pull request task looks like this:

## Ad-hoc Tasks

An ad-hoc task is a task that you define yourself, without the context of an issue or pull request. You can start an ad-hoc task from the Copilot Workspace dashboard, or from the repository page on GitHub.com.

Once started an ad-hoc task looks like this:

## Separate Repos for Issues and Code

<!-- TODO(eaftan): fill this in -->

Some teams use separate repositories for issues and code. If you're working in a repository that's different from the one where the issue was filed, you can still use Copilot Workspace. TODO.

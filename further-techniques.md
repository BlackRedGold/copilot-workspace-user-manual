## Separate Repos for Issues and Code

<!-- TODO(eaftan): fill this in -->

Some teams use separate repositories for issues and code. If you're working in a repository that's different from the one where the issue was filed, you can still use Copilot Workspace. TODO.

## Ambiguity Warnings

If Copilot Workspace detects that your task is overly ambiguous/unclear (e.g. it doesn’t seem aligned with the goals/focus of the repo), then it warn you about that and ask you to clarify the task further, before you can carry on. This is done to prevent hallucination in the plan and help guide you towards the “pit of success”, since subsequent stages of the workflow work best with sufficient detail.

## Incoming Links

Copilot Workspace has a capability for the task to be specified by query parameters when the subject is a repository, branch or pull request. 

```
https://copilot-workspace.githubnext.com/githubnext/copilot-workspace/pull/695?task=Add%20more%20unit%20tests%20to%20this%20pull%20request.```
```

The query parameters supported are

- `task` - The description of the task. If not specified, and the subject is an issue, the body of the issue is used, otherwise no task body is used and the user must enter one.
- `codeOwner` - The organization or individual for the code repository associated with an issue, e.g. `githubnext` for `githubnext/copilot-workspace`
- `codeRepo` - The name of the code repository associated with an issue, e.g. `copilot-workspace` for `githubnext/copilot-workspace`
- `branch` - The SHA or branch name to analyze the task at, e.g. `main`
